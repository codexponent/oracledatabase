# Oracle Database
--------

This Database Design is done on Oracle with APEX as a GUI for easier implementaion of table, views and triggers. Altogether, there are 11 tables created <br />
- Volunteer
- Skill
- Vol_Skill
- Project
- Task
- Skill_Task
- Task_Activity
- Project_Contact
- Travel_Booking
- Travel_Option
- Project_Location <br />
After the table 3 views and 2 triggers were created. Using APEX, I was able to create individual forms and pages for all the tables where data can be edited easily and simply. Using APEX bar graphs, pie charts and calendar were also created to visualize the graph much more easily.<br />
A Real Production Application can be made with this codebase if contributors are there to help. Everybody is welcome!!<br /> <br />
